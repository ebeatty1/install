# Install
Script for automating the setup of a normal working environment on a fresh install. This is designed to work on Arch-based 
distros, but should work just fine as long as pacman is installed. 

## Dependencies
`pacman`

## Instructions
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebeatty1/install/master/install.sh
sh ./install.sh
```
